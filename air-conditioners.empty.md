**Key health considerations:**

- 52% of regular AC users report fatigue and body aches[^1]
- AC environments can increase metabolic energy expenditure by 10-20%[^2]
- Optimal temperature settings: 75-78째F (24-26째C) for daytime, 67-70째F (19-21째C) for sleep[^3]
- Proper humidity maintenance (40-60%) and regular system maintenance are crucial for health[^4]
