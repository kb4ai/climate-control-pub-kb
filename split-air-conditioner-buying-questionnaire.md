# Split AC Cable Installation Questionnaire (WIP)

## Cable Flexibility & Routing

**1. What is the actual cable bending radius (not what photos suggest)?**
- [ ] Very flexible (<10 cm radius)
- [ ] ~20 cm radius (like optical cable)
- [ ] Very stiff (>20 cm radius)
- [ ] Unknown/need to verify

**2. Can the cable be disconnected and reconnected for wall installation?**
- [ ] Yes - documented in manual
- [ ] Yes - but only found in online videos/forums
- [ ] No
- [ ] Need to research

**3. If considering cable modification, where did you find instructions?**
- [ ] Official manual
- [ ] YouTube video for this model
- [ ] YouTube video for variant model (e.g., Tvotec version of Remco)
- [ ] Haven't found any
- [ ] Other: _________________

## Safety

**4. Is your room larger than 4 mÂ²?**
- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No (fire hazard risk if refrigerant leaks)

## Documentation

**5. Does the manual list individual components (like premium products)?**
- [ ] Yes, with part numbers
- [ ] No
- [ ] Haven't checked

**Notes:**
- Cable is typically ~3.7-4cm diameter, 3m long
- Check variant models for better documentation
- Verify actual flexibility before buying - photos can be misleading

## Health and Wellness Considerations

Before purchasing, consider the health impacts of prolonged AC exposure:

**6. Are you aware of potential health effects from AC usage?**
- [ ] Yes, I understand the risks of fatigue, dehydration, and sleep disruption[^health]
- [ ] No, I need to research this further
- [ ] Partially aware

**7. Do you plan to implement health-conscious AC usage practices?**
- [ ] Yes, including optimal temperature settings and regular breaks[^practices]
- [ ] No, comfort is priority
- [ ] Need guidance on best practices
